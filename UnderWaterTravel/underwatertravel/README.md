The site was made by one person (me), so you won't see much here.
I made this site as a project from several people who want to fulfill their dream by diving to the bottom of the ocean and finding out what is hidden there. 
To do this, they create their own website, where people can join them, help financially or in other ways, and follow the news on this topic.
So far, the site looks rustic, its buttons do not respond to clicks, and there are links only in one place, but it has a nice style and simple navigation.
__NOTE!__
this site looks normal __only for phones and PC__ so far, there may be problems with other devices!
